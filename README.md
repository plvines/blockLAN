# blockLAN
This is a Chrome browser extension designed to prevent requests to LAN IP addresses (192.168.\*, 10.\*). These types of requests can be a security vulnerability, because they can allow malicious sites to execute requests from a client to the LAN-side of their router or other devices. Many routers have administrative access restricted to the LAN-side of the network as a security feature. However, recent attacks have utilized client browsers to make requests to this LAN-side and then compromise routers from the more vulnerable LAN-side.

This extension should block any request made to an address of 192.168.\*. 10.\*, or \*.local from the Chrome browser (this covers HTTP(S) and FTP protocols), and will popup a notification when it does so. If you are intentionally trying to connect to a LAN IP from your browser, such as to configure your router, you will need to temporarily disable this extension: clicking on the icon in Chrome gives the option to disable it for 5 minutes to perform tasks like reconfiguring a router.
